# Gender Representation Research Project

## Overview

This research project aims to investigate the representation of female book authors on WikiData by utilizing a dataset obtained from the Amazon marketplace. The project involves a multi-step analysis, including deducing author gender by name, categorizing authors into distinct groups, and comparing the coverage of these authors on WikiData.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this research is to shed light on the gender distribution within the dataset and assess the representation of female authors on WikiData. By conducting this analysis, we hope to contribute valuable insights to discussions surrounding gender diversity and representation in digital knowledge repositories.

### Deduction of Author Gender

In the first step of our project, we attempt to deduce author gender by analyzing names. It's important to note that this is a coarse approximation, and in a proper context, gender should be asked directly from individuals. Our intent is to use this preliminary analysis to explore broad patterns within the dataset.

## Methodology

1. **Deduction of Gender by Name:**
   - We employ a name-based matching approach to categorize authors into three groups: male authors, female authors, and those with inconclusive or collective work.

2. **Dataset Splitting:**
   - Authors are segmented into the aforementioned groups for further analysis.

3. **Comparison on WikiData:**
   - We aim to find the authors on WikiData and compare the coverage of each group.

## Disclaimer

While we acknowledge the limitations of deducing gender solely based on names, we approach this project with sensitivity and respect for the diverse identities of individuals. Our goal is to initiate a meaningful analysis of gender representation within the scope of our dataset.
